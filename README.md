# Nautilus Twitter: An application built with Nautilus

This example application is built on top of the [Nautilus reproducible build template](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus), with custom modifications to support a specific use case.

For all components other than the frontend, refer to the main [Nautilus repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus).

To run this frontend locally, update [the configs](https://github.com/MystenLabs/nautilus-twitter/blob/main/frontend/src/networkConfig.ts) then: 

```
cd frontend
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
